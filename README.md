### Hi there 👋

I'm Segfaultd, and I love tech. I mostly do software engineering, but I also like infrastructure, deployment and scability concepts.

I have interest in reverse-engineering, and am super familiar with IDA Pro software. In 2021-2022, we built a collaboration with Ubisoft to bring User-Generated-Content to Watch Dogs Legion. They wrote an [article](https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/5mgRaWclQ5jI6T1HntDh0X/how-ubisoft-and-nomad-group-modded-watch-dogs-legion) on it.

## Skills

- **Typescript, C++, Go**. My go-to stack. I dream about it.
- **Blockchain engineering**. Core contributor to Cosmos-based blockchains
- **Database engineering**. Deployed production-grade PostgreSQL & Elasticsearch for high-traffic applications
- **Reverse engineering**. Mostly on games, understanding inner structures, breaking logics, and adding new features
- **Infrastucture / Deployment**. Built [Pulseheberg](https://pulseheberg.com) (french hosting company) 13 years ago, and still counting!
